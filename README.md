# MySearchTree: A Binary Search Tree for Name Management in Java

Welcome to the MySearchTree project! This project is a Java-based application that creates a binary search tree specifically designed for storing and managing names.

## Project Description

The MySearchTree is a backend application that implements a binary search tree. The tree stores names and supports operations like adding a name, finding a name, counting leaves, parents, and two-child parents, and printing the tree in a pre-order traversal.

Please note: This project is purely for demonstration purposes and does not process actual data.

## Key Features

- **Binary Search Tree**: Utilizes a binary search tree to dynamically store and manage names.
- **Name Management**: Allows users to add and find names in the tree.
- **Counting Nodes**: Provides functionality to count leaves, parents, and two-child parents in the tree.
- **Tree Display**: Prints node values using a pre-order traversal.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Advanced Java Programming**: Showcases advanced programming concepts like binary search trees, recursion, nested classes, and object-oriented programming.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures that user data falls within the proper range and prevents users from adding invalid names.
- **User Interface Design**: Presents a user-friendly interface for managing the tree.

## Technical Details

The MySearchTree is developed using Java. It employs a binary search tree to store and manage names based on user inputs.
